As of 3/6, this extension has ~105,000 users (gg on 100k lmao) meaning 105,000 fewer people have to use iReady. Problem is, that barely makes a dent in i-Ready's 10,000,000+ students (1.05%). If your school uses i-Ready, recommend this extension. They'll thank you.

## Disclaimers
<details>
<summary><b>Details</b></summary>
iReady is awful. It's the worst education tool anyone could ever use. I'm fed up with being forced to mindlessly watch the result of a greedy corporation that doesn't try in the SLIGHTEST to make their product enjoyable, or even acceptable. This repository is a collection of hacks and a chrome extension that ensures nobody has to suffer through iReady ever again. The current version has a **lesson & quiz skipper, a diagnostic hack, and a minutes hack**. The diagnostic hack currently is not instantaneous, and questions will have to be inputted manually.

<details>
<summary><b>Other Info</b></summary>
while (obviously) I try my hardest to prevent you from getting in trouble, there are some things you need to know in order to not get caught. First, I heavily do not recommend using it in school (as they can see all your network traffic) or even on a school issued laptop (only do it if you have to). If want to be very safe, use your own personal computer at your own home.

<details>
	<summary><b>Changes made (from original version)</b></summary>
Differences/Changes made from ArjhanToteck's original i-Ready Overload include rewritten functions (lesson skipper, minutes hack), newer code is now obfuscated, and portions of the UI changed to bypass i-Ready "anticheat".

## FAQ
  <details>
  	<summary><b>How do I send feedback about this thing?</b></summary>

  You can bring up an issue on the Github repository or leave a comment on our Discord server (listed at the top of this page). But please, do be sure to check the rest of the FAQ before bringing up an issue.
  </details>

  <details>
  	<summary><b>The script isn't working, what do I do?</b></summary>

  It may be that you have an old version, or that you simply followed the wrong steps (i.e not putting a colon after javascript in the bookmarklet). Always check either of these two options before complaining. In the worst case scenario, it might be that the script itself has been patched, but it's not likely to happen for a while. (Please be patient about this.)
  </details>

  <details>
  	<summary><b>Is there something like this for other school related programs?</b></summary>

  you can join the discord and ask for something to be made but your best bet would most likely be to use some of the following:
  <ul>
  	<li>https://botanybay.vercel.app/ (Savvas Realize)</li>
  	<li>https://www.symbolab.com/ (Math related)</li>
  	<li>https://www.mathway.com/Algebra (Math related)</li>
  	<li>https://photomath.com/ (Math related)</li>
  </ul>
  Please be aware that I do not own the above sites, and that again, common sense is needed when using these (i.e. not using them in school and only at home when possible).

As shown below iReady's developer team has hilariously banned the text "iReady Overload" from their site so chances are they're reading this right now
